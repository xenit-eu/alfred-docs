# Using panels
Panels are the basic blocks of the User Interface. A panel rests in a panel group. A panel group can contain multiple panels. Panels can be closed and opened. You can organize the panels by drag and drop. Panel groups can hide the title of its containing panels if the panel is too small. You can save and load how your panels are configured with panel configurations.

## Basic interactions

### Open a panel

In case you are missing a panel, you can open the panel.

You can't open a panel if the panel group is maximized.

1. Hover over \faicon{window-maximize} in the sidebar. \
   The panels in light grey are already open in Alfred Finder. You can open the same panel more than once, but that is not recommended because it uses space.
2. Click and drag the panel to the preferred position. \
   The position of the panel appears as a grey outline.
3. Drop the panel.

### Close a panel

1. Click **\faicon{times}** in the tab of the panel.
