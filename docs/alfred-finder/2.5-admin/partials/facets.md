# Filters

## Introduction

Easy to use filtering functionality without having to type in the searchbar is available in the _Filters_ panel, by default on the left side of the search result.

This list of filters and the values present in the found documents will be shown. By clicking on one of the filter values, an extra chip for this filter field is inserted in the searchbar, and the search is limited to the documents with that field value.

The filters that are shown in this list can be configured in Alfresco, either using the [configuration file](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/concepts/filtered-search-prop.html) or with the [Share Search Manager](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/concepts/super-search-manager.html)
