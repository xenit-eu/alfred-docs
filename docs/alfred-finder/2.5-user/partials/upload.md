# Uploading files

Alfred Finder can upload new files to folders in Alfresco, and you can edit their metadata immediately after uploading.

Upload functionality is available in the **Upload** panel, which is hidden by default. The upload panel will appear automatically when you upload a file.

## Upload one or more files

You can upload a file (or multiple files at once) in two places:

* You can use the **Explorer** panel to browse to the desired folder.
  Once you find your desired folder, you can:
  * Use the context menu to upload a file \

  * Drag and drop a file on the folder to upload it \

* You can click the upload button next to the searchbar to upload a file. \

  You will then be asked to browse to the folder where you want to store the file. \

With the upload panel open, you have additional options to upload one or more files:

* By using the upload button in the upload panel \

## Opening the upload panel

The upload panel is automatically shown when uploading documents, but you can also make the panel visible by dragging it in place from the **Panels** sidebar.

## Modifying metadata

Clicking on the \faicon{pencil} button next to a document in the Upload panel will open the **Metadata** panel in edit mode,
so you can immediately start editing the metadata of the document you just uploaded.
