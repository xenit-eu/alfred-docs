## Configure the language

If this language does not match your preferred language, you can change it in the menu.
The chosen language is stored in your browser, this means you only need to change the language once, if needed.

Changing the language will remove all saved panel configurations!

2. Click on the preferred language.

The application will be reloaded in the selected language.
